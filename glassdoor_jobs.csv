Group Summary

Our Global Health (GH) Program harnesses advances in science and technology to save lives in poor countries. We focus on the health problems that have a major impact in developing countries but get too little attention and funding. Where proven tools exist, we support sustainable ways to improve their delivery. Where they don’t, we invest in research and development of new interventions, such as vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics. Our work in infectious diseases focuses on strategies to fight and prevent HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, neglected and other infectious diseases, enteric and diarrheal diseases and pneumonia. These strategies are supported by functional teams that focus on Discovery and Translational Sciences, Vaccine Development, and Integrated Development.

Working closely with other global teams, the Innovative Technology Solutions (ITS) team invests in a high volume of high risk early-stage technologies and platform approaches with application in global health and more broadly in biomedicine. The team utilizes an investment model to de-risk new technologies and drive ambitious, transformative innovations swiftly to proof-of-concept and exit to internal and/or external partners. Additionally, the ITS team funds work to develop diagnostic tests for foundation-priority diseases and evaluate and develop new technologies to enable health care via a mobile phone.

Leadership & Culture

Our culture shapes our choices about what we do and how we do it. We believe that energized people, working well together, fueled by great leadership in an inclusive environment can do extraordinary things. We expect foundation employees to intentionally and consistently embody our four agreements; show respect, offer trust, be transparent, and create energy.

This particular Talent Pool position allows us to pipeline these outstanding people in an organized fashion so that we can react swiftly and accurately to Cumming’s hiring needs as we continue to grow.

What’s in it for you? Hopefully you will receive a positive application experience due to the uniquely transparent process we are committed to for both our open positions and our Talent Pool positions. And, by being part of our Talent Pool, you may be one of the first people we contact upon a new position being opened. Another assurance, Cumming holds all applications to our Talent Pools in the utmost confidentiality.

What’s in it for us? It’s our hope that by using Talent Pools, Cumming will have the opportunity to get to know you so that once a position opens, we are ahead of the curve and able to quickly - and confidently - reach out to someone in our Talent Pool for consideration. Another benefit is our reduced need to advertise for open positions since our various Talent Pools will be stacked with excellent prospective candidates.

By applying to this Talent Pool, you are not actually applying for a specific position, but investing in your future by allowing us the opportunity to get to know you and reach out when the time comes.

In order to remain in this Talent Pool, you should have extensive experience and/or a specialization within the project management service line. Years of experience, at this time, doesn’t matter as much because a future career opportunity with our firm could call for someone from an entry-level to an Executive-level role. All we ask is that you specialize in the area the Talent Pool represents.

***Note: If you see a position advertised that is a fit for your experience, please apply to this Talent Pool folder in addition to the advertised position.
